1. The Use of session is for maintaining user state, such as the authenticated user. The "actingAs" helper   	    maintaining method provides a simple way to authenticate a given user as the current user.
	   For example, we may use a model factory to generate and authenticate a user:


		abstract class TestCase extends BaseTestCase
		{
			use CreatesApplication;

			public function user()
			{
				return factory(User::class)->create();
			}
		}


		
        $this->actingAs($this->user())
                ->post('/posts', $params)
                ->assertStatus(302)
                ->assertSessionHas('status');
