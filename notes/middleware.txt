1. MIDDLEWARE : constructor is a place, where we can register middleware.
	claas in middleware folder can do something for us before the request or after the request.

	middleware class are registered inside kernal.php with same or different name.

2. Ways to register middleware:
		1. inside route.php =>  ->middleware('auth/middleware_name')	
		2. inside controller class => $this->middleware('auth/middleware_name');
		3. $this->middleware('auth/middleware_name')->only(['function_name']);;
		4. $this->middleware('auth/middleware_name')->except(['function_name']);;
