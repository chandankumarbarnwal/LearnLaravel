1. SEED:  Laravel includes a simple method of seeding your database with test data using seed classes. 

2. execute to perform seeding:  php artisan db:seed

3.  Regenarate table with seed flag =>  php artisan migrate:refresh --seed

4. To create new seeder class:  php artisan make:seeder CommentsTableSeeder

5. composer dump-autoload (vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php)=>
	
		This file is regenerated on each dump-autoload. If you have a new class somewhere in your project it will not be loaded unless it is included in autoload_classmap (hence you have to execute composer dump-autoload)

6.  php artisan db:seed --class=UsersTableSeeder => to seed single file

7. When we do seeding then interact with users: we can use this type method

        if($this->command->confirm('Do you want to refresh database')){
            $this->command->call('migrate:refresh');
            $this->command->info('Database refreshed');
        }

        $usersCount = max((int)$this->command->ask('How many users would you like?', 20),1);

When we execute db:seed then will confirm from user and display appropriate msg.

If we don't want to interact with with user then use "-n" flag

php artisan db:seed -n
